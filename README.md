The Higgs decay to tau leptons provides an excellent handle to study the Higgs coupling to fermions. These couplings can be used to gain greater understanding of the nature of the Higgs boson as well as enabling searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. An especially interesting place to conduct these studies is in the region of phase space where the Higgs decays to significantly boosted tau leptons. In this region, the two taus can merge into a single jet leading to increased difficulty in identification. A dedicated strategy is required to properly handle these taus. This repository contains the tools needed to study Higgs bosons decaying to boosted taus along with numerous studies conducted in this region of phase space.
